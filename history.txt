Model Masters was originally a google site for sharing model cars the cousins made, as an alternative to sending them via a groupchat. 
Although the original site served it's purpose well, it was drag and drop and only had the capabilities of a power point presentation. 
This made adding new models a whole process because the entire site had to be manually updated. 
After I (Aidan) completed my software development camp, I realized I had the ability to transform Model Masters into a professional application where automation would make the site much more user friendly. 
My motivation for completing the project was not to create a better Model Masters, but rather to gain more experience and practice my skills.
Model Masters was coded from scratch, not using a website builder or Wordpress, but rather the same modern frameworks that power Facebook, Netflix, AirBnb, and more. 
Behind the scenes, the site is compromised of around 70 files and over 3,000 lines of code in multiple languages.
